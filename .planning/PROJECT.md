# NextGen Preservation Collab Directory

## What This Is

A public-facing web directory for the NextGen Preservation Collab in Louisville, KY — connecting builders, craftspeople, tradespeople, developers, investors, advocates, and all stakeholders in the historic preservation ecosystem. Anyone can browse and search the directory; members can submit listings for admin approval.

## Core Value

People working in Louisville's historic preservation ecosystem can find and connect with each other — because right now, they can't.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Public searchable directory of preservation stakeholders
- [ ] Listings with name, contact info, role/category, specialties, and project portfolio
- [ ] Interactive map showing listed stakeholders and their locations
- [ ] Robust search with filters by role, specialty, and location
- [ ] Self-submission form for new listings
- [ ] Admin approval workflow before listings go live
- [ ] Admin dashboard to manage, edit, and approve/reject submissions
- [ ] Clean, modern, professional design reflecting the Collab's identity
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout
- [ ] Individual listing detail pages

### Out of Scope

- Messaging / chat between users — adds complexity, not core to directory value
- User accounts for public visitors — browsing should be frictionless
- Events calendar — separate concern from directory
- Blog / content management — the Collab already publishes Field Notes via UD Studio
- Payment processing — no monetization in v1
- Mobile native app — web-first, responsive design covers mobile

## Context

**The Organization:**
NextGen Preservation Collab is a growing community housed under UD Studio / Environome Institute (427 W Muhammad Ali Blvd, Suite 200, Louisville, KY). They connect preservation with walkability, public health, and inclusive development. Their ethos: "Anyone who loves their city can be a preservationist — no credentials required."

**The Problem:**
Louisville has a rich historic preservation ecosystem — builders restoring shotgun houses, investors in heritage properties, advocates fighting for cultural spaces — but these people have no centralized way to find each other. The directory fills that gap.

**Branding Context:**
- Clean, modern visual identity from UD Studio
- Fonts: Oswald, Lato, Inter
- Dark backgrounds with white logo treatment
- Photography-forward (historic architecture imagery)
- Instagram: @nextgenpreservationcollab
- Contact: nextgenpreservationcollab@gmail.com

**Stakeholder Categories (non-exhaustive):**
- Builders & General Contractors
- Craftspeople (masonry, woodwork, metalwork, plaster, etc.)
- Tradespeople (electricians, plumbers, HVAC — historic-specific)
- Developers (real estate, historic tax credit projects)
- Investors (heritage property, community development)
- Advocates (policy, community organizing, neighborhood groups)
- Architects & Designers (historic preservation specialists)
- Government / Regulatory (KY Heritage Council, local landmarks commission)
- Nonprofits & Community Organizations
- Educators & Researchers

## Constraints

- **Design**: Simple, beautiful, modern, professional — no clutter
- **Data**: Clean database with structured, consistent data
- **Access**: Public browsing without login; admin features behind auth
- **Maintenance**: Must be manageable by non-technical Collab staff
- **Tech Stack**: No preference stated — research will determine best fit

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Public browse + member submission model | Maximizes directory visibility while controlling data quality | — Pending |
| Admin approval for submissions | Ensures listing quality and prevents spam | — Pending |
| Map as core feature | Geographic context matters for local preservation work | — Pending |
| No user accounts for browsers | Reduces friction — the goal is connecting people, not gating access | — Pending |

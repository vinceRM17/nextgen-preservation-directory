## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Messaging / chat between users | Adds complexity, not core to directory value |
| User accounts for public visitors | Browsing should be frictionless |
| Events calendar | Separate concern from directory |
| Blog / content management | Collab publishes Field Notes via UD Studio already |
| Payment processing | No monetization in v1 |
| Mobile native app | Web-first, responsive design covers mobile |
| User reviews / ratings | Liability and moderation burden, not appropriate for professional ecosystem |
| Social features (follows, feeds) | Scope creep — directory is about discovery, not social networking |
| Paid listing tiers | Conflicts with Collab's inclusive mission |
